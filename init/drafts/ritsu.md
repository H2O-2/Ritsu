> *For Ritsu*

Static site generator made by TypeScript &amp; Node.js.

[Demo](http://blog.h2o2.me/)

## Installation

    $ npm install -g ritsu

Or use from source

    $ git clone https://github.com/H2O-2/ritsu.git
    $ cd ritsu/dist
    $ node index [command]

## Usage

Ritsu comes with a full set of command-line tool.

### init

Initialize blog.

    $ ritsu init [blog-name]
    $ ritsu i [blog-name]

This command will initialize a blog directory. If no blog name specified, the directory name will default to `new-blog`.

### new

Create a new post.

    $ ritsu new <post> [template]
    $ ritsu n <post> [template]

This command will create a new empty post. If no template is specified, Ritsu will use template named default.md in the `templates` directory. You can find the created post in `drafts` directory and start writing!

### publish

Publish your post.

    $ ritsu publish <post> [date]
    $ ritsu p <post> [date]

This command will publish your post. Note that only published posts can be generated. If no date is specified (for the formate of the date see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) then ritsu will use current time. You can find the published post in `posts` directory.

### delete

Delete your post.

    $ ritsu delete <post>
    $ ritsu d <post>

This command will delete your **published** post and move the deleted post to `trash` directory. If you want to recover the post, please move the post to the `drafts` directory first, then run `ritsu publish` again.

### generate

Generate blog.

    $ ritsu generate [directory-name]
    $ ritsu g [directory-name]

This command will build all EJS and style files and generate your blog. If no directory name is specified, the directory name will default to `publish`.
> Note: Use this command only if it's the first time your are generating your site or have made changes to configs and styles. Otherwise [ritsu update](#update) is faster.

### purge

Purge generated blog.

    $ ritsu purge <generated-directory>

This command will remove the site generated by `ritsu generate`.

### update

Update blog.

    $ ritsu update [generated-directory]

This command will update the blog with your new posts and keep other componenets (e.g. style) intact, thus faster than `ritsu generate`.

### deploy

Deploy blog to GitHub.

    $ ritsu deploy [generated-directory]

This command will deploy your blog to GitHub. Remember to specify your GitHub info in `site-config.yaml`!



> Note: If you are encountering problems with `node-sass` module, modify your npm permission according to [instructions here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
